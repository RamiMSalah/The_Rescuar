# The_Rescuar
We are building a movable electricity distribution system which will solve the
problems that face companies, homes, and factories. Many factories' infrastructures
are burned out because of the increasing or decreasing in the electricity input and
output for these places. To solve this problem, we are addressing a system that will
distribute the energy to homes, factories, and companies with the least energy loss
and errors in distribution. In our project we have two mobile apps, the first one will
be used by the users and they will define the devices at their homes and our app
will send back to the distribution system the best amount of energy to boost or 
decrease. On the administration app, we will be able to see how the whole project
operates. If any other problem is detected, the car system will capture a photo of it
and send it to the database. After the problem is recognized, the robot car will try
to solve it and if it couldn’t a notification will be sent to the admins telling them
that there is an error and they go solve it. The car is independent and it can go itself
anywhere to solve the electricity problem if the problem is at its range area. The
car works with solar heat by converting it to electricity using the Peltier effect. We
are using a solar tracker system to detect the best place that contains the solar heat
using servo motors and an “LDR” sensor. The system will generate energy in the
future using mechanical and magnetic energy
